# Electricity-Demand-Forecasting-Time-Series-Analysis
I built an average hourly electricity demand forecasting system for each month, using historical hourly consumption data using models like ARIMA, Random Forest and LSTM. Performed EDA to understand patterns, optimized models through hyperparameter tuning and feature selection. Deployed the optimized model using Streamlit web app.
